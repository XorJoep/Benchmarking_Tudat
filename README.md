# Benchmarking Tudat

The files used to benchmark the Tudat software are placed here. 

## Getting Started

Get familiar with the Tudat software at the [Tudat website](http://tudat.tudelft.nl/).

### Prerequisites

You should have Tudat installed on your machine to use the C++ files. Matlab is needed to process the generated output.

### Contents

The Multicase folder consists of the C++ files and their example JSON files that can be used by Tudat to propagate orbits with different propagators and integrators.
The Matlab files include data processing scripts and a GUI.
The graphs folder are filled with graphs that have been used by the authors to compare the results and are the product of some Matlab files.
